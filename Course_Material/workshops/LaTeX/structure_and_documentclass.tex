	\label{sec:introduction}
		Welcome to your first \LaTeX{} document. Look at each comment in the source file to observe how the document is rendered when you apply them. One of them will lead to a compilation error, can you identify which one?
		That document presents most of the commands you should need to structure your reports.

			% Observe how those sentences are written here in the source document and how they are rendered in the pdf. Do you have an idea on how to enforce a distance between the words (if you wanted one?)
			% Do you know how to display those sentences on two different lines? and in two different paragraphs?
			% What is the difference between the two?
			My first sentence.
			My   second   sentence.
			
		\subsection{Second subsection of the first section}
		
		To make lists:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item First reason

		\subsubsection{Some subsubsection}
		
		The text appears underneath the subsubsection title\dots

	\section*{Section that is not referenced}
	% This section exists in the document, but is not referenced in the table of content.
	% What can you change to make this section referenced again?
	
	You might have seen in the source code that we have added a label in section	\ref{sec:introduction}. Now create a new section before section \ref{sec:introduction}, such that the First section is not the first any more. What happened to that reference? 
	
	% Now include the package hyperref (uncomment the corresponding line in the introduction). What changed in the document? Now try to use \autoref{sec:introduction} to make your reference? How is it any different from \ref{sec:introduction}?
	
	% \autoref{sec:introduction}
